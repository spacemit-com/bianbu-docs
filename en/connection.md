## Connecting to a Wired Network

Plug in the Ethernet cable, and Bianbu Desktop will automatically obtain an IP address from DHCP. You can find the current IP address using the following methods.

**Method One**

1. Open "Settings."
2. Go to the "Network" menu.
3. Click the settings button of the connected network card.
4. A dialog box will appear showing the IP address.

**Method Two**

Open a terminal in Bianbu Desktop and execute `ifconfig`. The IPv4 address appears after `inet`.

## Connecting to a Wireless Network

1. Open "Settings."
2. Go to the "Wi-Fi" menu.
3. Click on the network name you want to use.
4. If the network is password-protected, enter the password when prompted and click "Connect."
5. The network icon will change as the computer connects to the network.
6. If the connection is successful, the icon will show a dot with arc-like lines. More lines indicate a stronger connection, while fewer suggest weaker and potentially unstable connectivity.
